## 📱 Companion iOS App

Scan a room with your iPhone and get an editable floor plan in seconds. The OpenPlan3D iOS app uses LiDAR (with an AR fallback for non-LiDAR devices) to build walls, doors, and windows as you walk, calculates room areas automatically, and shows the result in 2D and 3D — then hands the plan off to the web editor with one tap (see [iOS capture handoff](#-ios-capture-handoff)).

## 🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to try openplan3d is the hosted version at **[app.openplan3d.com](https://app.openplan3d.com/)** — no install needed.

To run it locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/laanlabs/openPlan3D.git
cd openPlan3D

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Tests and checks

```bash
npm test            # unit + integration tests (Vitest)
npm run test:watch  # watch mode
npm run test:e2e    # end-to-end tests (Playwright, real browser)
npm run test:e2e:ui # E2E in Playwright's interactive UI
npm run check       # svelte-check type checking
```

Geometry and persistence suites run without a renderer or a dev server, so they are fast and
usable in CI. E2E specs live in `e2e/` and drive a real Chromium against the app; Playwright
starts its own dev server, so no manual setup is needed. First run requires the browser:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Continuous integration

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every push and pull request to
`main`:

| Job | Step | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `verify` | `npm run check` | Fails if the `svelte-check` error count rises above the recorded baseline |
| `verify` | `npm test` | Must pass |
| `verify` | `npm run build` | Must pass |
| `e2e` | `npm run test:e2e` | Must pass; report uploaded as an artifact on failure |

`e2e` is a separate job so downloading a browser never delays feedback from the fast checks.

The type-check step compares against a baseline rather than requiring zero errors, because
6 pre-existing errors are inherited from upstream — see
[`docs/baseline.md`](docs/baseline.md). Lower `BASELINE_CHECK_ERRORS` in the workflow as they
are fixed; never raise it.

## 📱 iOS capture handoff

The companion iOS app can hand a fresh [Apple RoomPlan](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/roomplan/) scan directly to the web editor via Firebase Storage:

1. The iOS app uploads the RoomPlan `room.json` to Firebase Storage at `inbox/{CODE}.json` in the `openplan3d.firebasestorage.app` bucket, where `CODE` is 8 characters from `[A-Z2-9]` (I, O, 0 and 1 are excluded to avoid ambiguity).
2. The app shows a QR code / link of the form:

   ```
   https://app.openplan3d.com/editor?import=CODE
   ```

3. When the editor opens with an `import` query param, it downloads the JSON straight from Firebase Storage (no SDK needed):

   ```
   https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/openplan3d.firebasestorage.app/o/inbox%2F{CODE}.json?alt=media
   ```

   and imports it through the regular RoomPlan pipeline (default options: straighten + orthogonal), creating a new project. On success the `import` param is replaced with the new project's `id` so a refresh won't re-import.

Access is controlled by [`storage.rules`](storage.rules): public **read** and **create** are allowed only on `inbox/{CODE}.json` (content type `application/json`, < 10 MB); updates, deletes, and everything else in the bucket are denied.

### One-time setup (project owner)

1. **Enable Storage** for the `openplan3d` project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/openplan3d/storage) if it isn't already.
2. **Deploy the rules:**

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only storage
   ```

3. **Auto-delete stale captures** — set a lifecycle rule that deletes objects under the `inbox/` prefix after 1 day (prefix-scoped lifecycle uses `matchesPrefix`). Save this as `lifecycle.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "rule": [
       {
         "action": { "type": "Delete" },
         "condition": { "age": 1, "matchesPrefix": ["inbox/"] }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Then apply it with either:

   ```bash
   gcloud storage buckets update gs://openplan3d.firebasestorage.app --lifecycle-file=lifecycle.json
   # or
   gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://openplan3d.firebasestorage.app
   ```

4. **CORS** — the editor downloads captures from the browser, so the bucket must allow
   cross-origin GETs (without this the import fails with a CORS error in the console).
   Save this as `cors.json`:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "origin": [
         "https://app.openplan3d.com",
         "https://openplan3d--openplan3d.us-east4.hosted.app",
         "http://localhost:5173"
       ],
       "method": ["GET"],
       "responseHeader": ["Content-Type"],
       "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
     }
   ]
   ```

   Then apply it (changes take a minute or two to propagate):

   ```bash
   gcloud storage buckets update gs://openplan3d.firebasestorage.app --cors-file=cors.json
   ```
